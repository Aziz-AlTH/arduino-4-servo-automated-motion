# arduino-4-servo-automated-motion
This project demonstrates the control of **4 servo motors** in a humanoid robot using an Arduino. The servos simulate basic leg movements and hold a neutral standing pose. Additionally, an algorithm for humanoid walking motion is described to support future development of robotic locomotion.
